## Functionality
This is a real-time chat app. 
## Running the App
### Docker
#### Building the Container
note: Make sure `docker` or `docker desktop` is running.
We're using an Alpine Linux image in Docker to approximate Heroku's default dyno container, which uses a lightweight Linux distro.
From the root directory
```bash
docker compose up  
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

#### Stopping the Container
```bash
docker compose down
```

## Running Tests
The docker-compose file is rigged for live test watching. When running `docker compose up`,
the container `realtime-chat-jest` will run the unit tests and pass or fail accordingly.

If you're not running the docker container, you can manually run the tests with the `jest` command.
Please please please please please please please please please write unit tests before implementing anything.

## Accessing the Database
The app uses Upstash.com for database management, specifically the redis app. The REDIS_URL and REDIS_TOKEN are stored in  `.env.local`.

## Deploying the App
Continuous integration is set up with Heroku (live version at https://salthouse-chat-2e94934e3b3e.herokuapp.com/), 
when it's good to publish,
1. merge changes from `dev` to `main`
2. Open the heroku dashboard at `https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/salthouse-chat/deploy/github`
3. Hit "Deploy Branch from Main"

## Env Variables
The app uses the following .env variables.
```
REDIS_URL
REDIS_TOKEN
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
```
`REDIS` is for accessing the redis database via upstash.com
`GOOGLE_CLIENT` is for OAuth login via the users' google account

## OAuth
For Google, go to https://console.cloud.google.com/ to configure the credentials.
Authorized Javascript origin should be the homepage (for dev it's http://localhost:3000)
For the authorized redirect URI, set it to `<homepage>/api/auth/callback/google`
